1. In recursion, we should have a base case.
ex: 4! = 4 x 3!
       = 4 x 3 x 2!
       = 4 x 3 x 2 x 1!
       = 4 x 3 x 2 x 1
  Here, 1! = 1 is the base case

2. Base case loi goi thakute Problem tu smaller hoi hoi goi thakibo lage. As in the above example, ami 4! k vagi vagi
  last t 1! loi goi palu.

3. Backtracking :
Printing from start to end in the Normal approach
printing is started in the end and ended in the starting is back tracking. i.e., actual code execution tu last
r falor pora start hoi. 


In normal recursion things happens while going in forward pass, while
in backtracking, things happens in coming back, that's why the term backtracking.
