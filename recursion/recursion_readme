1. In recursion, we should have a base case.
ex: 4! = 4 x 3!
       = 4 x 3 x 2!
       = 4 x 3 x 2 x 1!
       = 4 x 3 x 2 x 1
  Here, 1! = 1 is the base case

2. Base case loi goi thakute Problem tu smaller hoi hoi goi thakibo lage. As in the above example, ami 4! k vagi vagi
  last t 1! loi goi palu.
