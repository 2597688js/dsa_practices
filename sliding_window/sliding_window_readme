# Sliding window readme

Sliding Window problems are problems in which a fixed or variable-size window is moved through a data structure,
typically an array or string, to solve problems efficiently based on continuous subsets of elements. This technique
is used when we need to find subarrays or substrings according to a given set of conditions.

The following pattern problems can be solved by sliding window / two pointer approach

1. Constant window

2. Longest subarray / substring where <condition>   -- Bruteforce, better, optimal

3. Number of subarrays where <condition>  -- Bruteforce, better, optimal
