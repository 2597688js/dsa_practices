Description :  Given an array of N integers, left rotate the array by one place.

Example 1:
    Input: N = 5, array[] = {1,2,3,4,5}
    Output: {5, 1, 2, 3, 4}
    Explanation:
        Since all the elements in array will be shifted toward right by one so ‘5’ will now become the
        first index and and ‘4’ which was present at second last index will be shifted at last.
